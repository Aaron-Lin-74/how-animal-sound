# The Animal Sounds web application is created by Aaron Lin for his beloved children and for kids to learn more about animals. 

We used React to create the UI and Google Firebase as the back-end which handles user authentication, and stores information about different kinds of animals, like images and sounds. 

It is fun to explore what different types of animals sound like. We will add more new animals constantly.

The live application is hosted using Firebase, please find the link below. Feel free to play around with it and you will find some animal sounds are so amazing!

## Features
* React function components and Google Firebase.
* Used Firebase back-end services for user authentication, object storage, and database.
* Combined useReducer and useContext hooks to perform state management.
* Applied styled component to style the components.

## Run the application locally
To run the application locally, clone the repo and install the dependencies:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Aaron-Lin-74/how-animal-sounds.git
$ cd how-animal-sounds
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Since the application used Firebase as the backend service, you might need to create your own Firebase account and set up 
the Authentication, Firestore and Storage. And create a .env file for all Firebase secrets. 
Please use the live demo instead.
