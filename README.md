# The Animal Sounds web application is created by Aaron Lin for his beloved children and for kids to learn more about animals. 

We used React to create the UI and Google Firebase as the back-end which handles user authentication, and stores information about different kinds of animals, like images and sounds. 

It is fun to explore what different types of animals sound like. We will add more new animals constantly.

The live application is hosted using Firebase, please find the link below. Feel free to play around with it and you will find some animal sounds are so amazing!
